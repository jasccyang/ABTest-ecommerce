## Introduction
For this project, I analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
<br>
The company and the dataset is not real. This is an exercise A/B Test.

## Part I - Probability
By examining our data in ab_data.csv, an individual in the control group has a probability of 0.0016 more likely to convert to the new landing page more than an individual in the treatment group. From this investigation, a 0.0016 probability difference seems too small of a margin to suggest one page leads to more conversions.

## Part II - A/B Test
Hypothesis stated in terms of  poldpold  and  pnewpnew , which are the converted rates for the old and new pages. <br>

Null hypothesis: experiment does equally or worse than the control. <br>
Alternative hypothesis: experiment does better than the control.
